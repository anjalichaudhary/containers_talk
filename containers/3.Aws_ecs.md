## AWS ECS

1. What is Amazon ECS?

    <details>
    <summary></summary>
    - fully managed container orchestration service by AWS
    - manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances or using the serverless AWS Fargate.
    - Cluster Management, Task Definitions, Service Definitions, Networking, Storage Integration, Security and Compliance, Monitoring and Logging
    </details>

2. ECS Launch Types
    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    ECS provies two primary launch types ECS with Fargate and ECS with EC2

    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    1. ECS with Fargate

    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    - serverless compute engine for containers
    - no need to manage underlying Ec2 instance
    - KB: Serverless, Auto-Scaling, Ease of Use, Resource-Based Pricing

    
    </details>
        
    2. ECS with EC2
    
    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    - deploying and managing containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances
    - we need to provision, manage and scale these instances
    - provides more control and flexibility over the infrastructure.
    - KB: Full Control(EC2 instances and their configurations), Customization(instance types, storage configurations, and network settings), Advanced Networking
    </details>

3. When to Use ECS with Fargate and ECS with EC2?

4. Where are we using ECS with Fargate and ECS with EC2?

5. Availability and Scaling in ECS 
    
6. Persisted Storage in ECS

    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    1. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS): block-level persisted storage, highly available and scalable, Ideal for applications requiring frequent writes and high-performance storage.
    2. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS): scalable file system, can be shared across multiple tasks, Suitable for applications requiring shared storage between containers.
