# Introduction to containerization.

1. Introduction to containerization.

    1. What is containerization?

        - Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container with its own operating environment.

        - It's a form of operating system virtualization. Each container stacks up, sharing the OS kernel with other containers.

        - Containers hold the components such as files, environment variables and libraries necessary to run the desired software without the need for a separate operating system.

    2. Why is containerization important in modern software development?

        1. Portability
        2. Efficiency
        3. Isolation
        4. Scalability
        5. Microservices architecture

        In summary, containerization streamlines the development and deployment process, making it faster, more efficient, and more reliable. This is essential for building and running modern software applications.

2. How did we ship before Docker?

    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    - Before Docker, the most common way to ship an application was to use a dedicated or shared server. The application was installed directly on the server operating system, and dependencies were managed at the system level.

    - cap deploy -- capistrano was used in or lti and lms applications which was essentially used to automate deployment of our web appliations to the ec2 machines

3.  Why Docker?

    1. **Simplicity & Speed**

    2. **Compatibility & Maintainability**:  "it works on my machine" problem. A Docker container runs the same way, everywhere.

    3. **Isolation**: Docker ensures your applications and resources are isolated and segregated.

    4. **Scalability**: Docker can be integrated with orchestration services like ECS for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

    5. **Continuous Deployment and Testing**: Docker enables developers to easily deploy, replicate, move, and back up a working version of the application for diagnosis and troubleshooting.

    6. **Version Control and Component Reuse**: Docker allows you to version control not just your appâ€™s source code but also the environment in which it runs. You can also reuse components from the preceding layers, which makes them much lighter in size.

4. Pros and Cons of Docker compared to VMs

    1. Pros:

    - **Portability**
    - **Efficiency** 
    - **Isolation** 
    - **Version Control**
    - **Integration with CI/CD pipelines**
    </details>
    
    2. Cons:
    <details>
    <summary></summary>

    - **Persistent data storage**: Docker containers are ephemeral, meaning they don't persist data. You need to use Docker volumes or bind mounts to persist data.
    - **Complexity**: Initial Learning curve
    - **Security**: While Docker does provide some level of isolation, it is not as secure as a full-fledged virtual machine. Running untrusted or poorly configured containers can pose a security risk.
